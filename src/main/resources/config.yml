# How to hide and show plugins:
#
# Let's say you have these plugins:
# - pluginA
# - pluginB
# - pluginC
# - pluginD
# - pluginE
#
# Now on to the configuration:
#
# 1) I just want to hide pluginB:
#   hide_plugins:
#     - pluginB
#
# This means pluginA, pluginC, pluginD, and pluginE will be shown,
# but pluginB will be hidden.
#
# 2) I want to only show pluginB:
#   hide_plugins:
#     - '*'
#   show_plugins:
#     - pluginB
#
# This will hide all plugins except pluginB. Only pluginB will be visible.
# Using '*' will hide all plugins initially. Then, specifying pluginB in show_plugins will make them visible.
#
# 3) I want to hide multiple plugins, say pluginB and pluginD:
#   hide_plugins:
#     - pluginB
#     - pluginD
#
# This will hide pluginB and pluginD. The rest of the plugins (pluginA, pluginC, and pluginE) will be shown.
#
# 4) I want to show multiple plugins, say pluginA and pluginC:
#   hide_plugins:
#     - '*'
#   show_plugins:
#     - pluginA
#     - pluginC
#
# This will hide all other plugins except pluginA and pluginC. Only pluginA and pluginC will be visible.
#
# 5) I want to ensure no plugins are shown:
#   hide_plugins:
#     - '*'
#
# This will hide all plugins, regardless of what plugins are available.
#
# 6) I want to ensure all plugins are shown:
# Just don't install this plugin ðŸ˜‹!
#
# Remember, the show_plugins configuration takes precedence over hide_plugins.
# If a plugin is listed in both show_plugins and hide_plugins, it will be shown.


hide_plugins:
  - pluginhider

show_plugins:
  - '*'
